# Blocky Sea

This is a template of one way to achieve voxelized sea mesh. It is pretty unoptimized since I was a total beginner in shaders and mesh generation before this project, 
but since this project is licenced as The Unlicence, you are free to contribute to this project or just copy paste the code and optimize it in your project.
