# Blocky Sea

This is a template of one way to achieve voxelized sea mesh. It is pretty unoptimized since I was a total beginner in shaders and mesh generation before this project, 
but since this project is licenced as The Unlicence, you are free to contribute to this project or just copy paste the code and optimize it in your project.

Developed in Unity 6 Preview, version 6000.0.

A guide document of how this project works can be found [here](https://github.com/Robomarti/Blocky_Sea/blob/main/documentation/howEverythingWorks.md).

A document containing retrospective thoughts can be found [here](https://github.com/Robomarti/Blocky_Sea/blob/main/documentation/retrospective.md).

This project is heavily based on Sebastian Lague's ([SebLague](https://github.com/SebLague)) Procedural Terrain Generation tutorial series, which you can watch here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3

Many thanks to him.
