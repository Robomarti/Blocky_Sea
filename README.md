A quick demo of the shader and the generated mesh:

This is a template of one way to achieve voxelized sea mesh. I was inspired by the water in Lego Builder's Journey.

Lego Builder's Journey uses all kind of optimization tricks and a small size for its maps so that they can make it look as good as it looks. However, I wanted to build a template that can be adapted
to different goals so I was unable to use most of them.
The project might be quite unoptimized since I was a total beginner in shaders and mesh generation before this project, 
but since this project is licenced as The Unlicence, you are free to contribute to this project or just copy paste the code and optimize it in your project.

Developed in Unity 6 Preview, version 6000.0. The project uses Universal RP 17.0.3, Cinemachine 3.1.1 and Input System 1.8.2 packages.

A guide document of how this project works can be found [here](https://github.com/Robomarti/Blocky_Sea/blob/main/documentation/howEverythingWorks.md).

This project is heavily based on Sebastian Lague's ([SebLague](https://github.com/SebLague)) Procedural Terrain Generation tutorial series, which you can watch here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3

Many thanks to him.
